Popular SLQ APIs - application program begins its database access with one or more API calls that connect the program to the DBMS

SQL API consists of library function calls as API for the DBMS< connect (db,user, pswd), send (“update employees set,.”), execute(), status check(), ok, disconnect()

For this hands-on assignment, you will be working on several real-world datasets available from the Chicago Data Portal. You will be asked questions that will help you understand the data just like a data engineer would. You will be assessed both on the correctness of your SQL queries and results.
You will write SQL code to create a view that limits the data available to a user, create a stored procedure that users can run to update Leader Icons in the table, and then enclose that update code in a transaction to ensure that if an error occurs, your data remains in a consistent state.
Follow the instructions in the assignment to complete all the problems. Then share the Queries and Results with your peers for reviewing.Review criteria
